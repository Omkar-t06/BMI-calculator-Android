#### Basic BMI Calculator App
### A simple Android app designed to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI).

### This project serves as a foundational learning experience for Android development using Java.

## Key Features:

- Utilizes XML for layout creation (Linear Layout).
- Employs XML structuring for effective UI organization.
- Leverages Java to interact with UI elements through ID-based querying.

## Additional Learning Opportunities:

- Explore different layout types (e.g., RelativeLayout, ConstraintLayout) for advanced UI design.
- Implement input validation and error handling for robust user experience.
- Enhance the app with features like BMI category interpretation (underweight, normal, overweight, etc.) and visual representations of BMI results.
- Consider using data persistence (e.g., SharedPreferences, SQLite) to store user data.
